Um gafanhoto, morrendo de fome, passou e implorou fervorosamente por um pouco de comida. As formigas perguntaram a ele: &ldquo;Por que você não guardou comida no verão?&rdquo; Ele respondeu: &ldquo;Eu não tive tempo suficiente. Passei os dias cantando.&rdquo; Elas então disseram com escárnio: &ldquo;Se você foi tolo o suficiente para cantar durante todo o verão, você deve dançar sem jantar para a cama no inverno.&rdquo;</p></article></main></body></html>
