Now the one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy. So to punish them both, Jupiter granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his neighbour had twice as much. The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold. No sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal. Then came the turn of the envious man, who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all. So he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out, by which means his companion would become totally blind.</p><p>Vices are their own punishment.</p><hr><p>Dois vizinhos vieram antes de Júpiter e oraram para que ele atendesse ao desejo de seus corações. Ora, um estava cheio de avareza e o outro devorado de inveja. Portanto, para punir os dois, Júpiter concedeu que cada um pudesse ter tudo o que desejasse para si, mas apenas com a condição de que seu vizinho tivesse o dobro. O homem avarento orou para ter uma sala cheia de ouro. Não antes de dizer que acabou; mas toda a sua alegria se transformou em tristeza quando descobriu que seu vizinho tinha dois quartos cheios do metal precioso. Então chegou a vez do homem invejoso, que não suportava pensar que seu vizinho tivesse qualquer alegria. Por isso, ele orou para que arrancasse um de seus olhos, de modo que seu companheiro ficasse totalmente cego.</p><p>Os vícios são sua própria punição.</p></article></main></body></html>
